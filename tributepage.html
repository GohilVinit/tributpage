                    Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was a prominent Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Born Narendranath Datta in Kolkata, he was a disciple of the mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Vivekananda is best known for his inspiring speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, where he began with the words "Sisters and brothers of America," which earned him a standing ovation. His speech emphasized the universality of religion and the need for global tolerance and understanding.

                    Vivekananda's teachings focused on the importance of selflessness, the unity of all religions, and the potential of the human soul. He believed in the idea of "practical Vedanta," advocating for the application of spiritual principles in everyday life and social service. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which aimed at social reform, education, and philanthropy, inspired by the teachings of his guru, Ramakrishna.
